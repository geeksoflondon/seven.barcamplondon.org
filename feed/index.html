			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday morning, the registration desk will open at 9.30am. IBM operate a secure site policy and therefore we require you to bring along either:</p>
<ul>
<li> Some form of photo ID (e.g. passport, driving licence or student card).</li>
<li>A print-out of your BarCamp London 7 confirmation email, along with a bankcard or something official with your name on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you arrive at the venue, you will first be asked to verify your details with IBM security. Once this is complete, you will be issued with an IBM security pass. Afterwards you will be given your BarCamp London 7 badge.</p>
<p><strong>NB: Both your IBM security pass and BarCamp London 7 badge MUST be worn whilst you are on-site at the venue. Failure to wear these could result in you being asked to leave by IBM security or a member of the BarCamp London Crew.</strong></p>
<p>This process will be the same during registration on the Sunday for those who are either attending on the second day only or have stayed outside the venue overnight. Be aware that registration on Sunday starts at 9am GMT, and that this is after breakfast is served.</p>
<h3>Registration Queue Jumping</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to pass through registration quicker, we&#8217;d recommend that you bring a print-out of the email which was sent out on Wednesday morning (21st) along with you, particularly the section containing your name and custom bar code.<br />
<strong>Please note that we’ll still require you to bring ID, as stated above.<br />
</strong></p>
<h3>Getting To The Venue</h3>
<p>Please find more info on this on the <a href="/essential-information/">BarCamp Essential Information page</a>.</p>

<p>The N900 is Nokia&#8217;s new high performance touch screen mobile  computer. It is based on Maemo, an advanced Linux-based operating  system. This open-source platform enables the Maemo community to  modify and continually develop software without license restrictions  and fees meaning more choice for users and more freedom for  developers.</p>
<p>The device also features a powerful Mozilla browser giving full  access to rich interactive Flash content plus a multi-tasking  dashboard to enable easy tap between open apps and ongoing  conversations.</p>
<p>Check out the new Nokia at BarCamp on Saturday the 24th October.  Developer  Gary Liquid will be there to demo the device for anybody  who wants to learn more. He&#8217;ll also talk about developing  specifically for the N900 and the work he did on a N900 powered  onedotzero installation recently shown on the Southbank.</p>

<p>The Guardian News and Media (GNM) are one of the UK&#8217;s most successful and innovative media companies. They publish both the Guardian and Observer newspapers, as well as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Their  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">Open Platform</a> and Datastore projects puts them in a unique position in the media and among online data repositories. Their open approach of providing APIs, accompanied by client libraries in the web&#8217;s most popular languages and swathes of online documentation, makes them a great choice for sponsoring events such as ours.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Guardian for offering to sponsor BarCamp London 7.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BarCamp London is always hugely over-subscribed. We hate to disappoint anybody who hasn&#8217;t got a ticket, so have  now opened a <a href="http://bit.ly/4oHyed">reserve list</a> where you can sign up to be informed about any last minute returns that we may have.</p>
<p>We may contact you at any time between the time you fill in the form and the day of the BarCamp to offer you a ticket. Please note that completing the form does <strong>not</strong> mean you will automatically get a ticket. And if you turn up at the event without a ticket you <strong>will</strong> be refused entry.</p>
<p>Once again, we are asking that anyone with a<strong> </strong>ticket who finds they can&#8217;t make it for whatever reason, <strong>please </strong>let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:help@barcamplondon.org">help@barcamplondon.org</a> &#8211; even if this is on the day itself.</p>
<p>The sooner we know, the better. Your ticket can then be allocated to someone who is sure they can come along.</p>

From short range building-to-building links to secure, resilient, full-duplex links over several miles, they&#8217;ll work with you to plan and deploy your wireless network. They also supply indoor solutions, whether it be a single hotspot or complete building coverage.</p>
<p>Their newest product is Broadband Powerline, which enables data to be delivered over existing power cabling at up to 200Mbps! This is an ideal solution for entertainment complexes, apartment buildings, time-limited shows such as festivals and concerts and warehouses or buildings where running structured cabling is<br />
not an option, such as listed and heritage sites.</p>
<p>We are pleased that Nexus have offered us their expertise, and will be installing a complete wireless network within the IBM Southbank offices for our exclusive use over the BarCamp weekend. This should make the internet connectivity at BarCamp London 7 the most reliable yet!</p>
<p>One of the Nexus engineers, Wil Currie, will be on-site with us the entire weekend so make sure you say &#8216;Hello&#8217; to him at some point!</p>

<p>JISC inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies and has initiated and funded a large number of projects in the area of software development in education.</p>
<p>Recently, they&#8217;ve supported a number of projects through their <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11/jiscri/">Rapid Innovation</a> programme. These are community-based and work over short time spans with small teams developing solutions together with end users. There are presently over 40 of these projects in progress in many areas such as Mobile Applications (e.g. Android and iPhone), Mashups (e.g. RSS/Atom feeds, blogs and tags) and linked data (e.g. human relationships and academic communities).</p>
<p>They are also working closely with <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk">UKOLN</a> on a new project called the Developer Community Supporting Innovation &#8211; <a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/">DevCSI</a> which offers support to software developers working in Higher Education.  DevCSI is directly organizing and/or supporting (through sponsorship) networking and community building opportunities for developers such as face-to-face technical and non-technical events, workshops, smaller more agile events (e.g. BarCamps), training opportunities, technical prototyping events, showcasing and demonstration events to highlight the work and value that software developers bring to Higher Education. The DevCSI project team will be organising the next <a href="http://www.dev8d.org/">Developer Happiness Days</a> due to take place next Spring. If you are interested in the DevCSI project, please contact <a href="mailto:m.mahey@ukoln.ac.uk">Mahendra Mahey</a>.</p>

<p>You may be interested to know that JISC have a meeting space on Waterloo Bridge (just across the river from the IBM Southbank in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/places/gb/wc2e-7/london/lancaster-pl/1/-brettenham-house">Brettenham House</a>. They will gladly make this available free of charge to small open developer groups who want to put on their own mini BarCamp-style events (for upto 40 people!) &#8211; they&#8217;ll even provide the pizza! Interested parties should contact <a href="mailto:flandda@jisc.ac.uk">David Flanders</a> for more info!</p>
<p>We are pleased to have JISC and DevCSI as sponsors of BarCamp London 7. They are directly supporting the attendance of a number of  developers from UK Higher Education to the event.</p>
