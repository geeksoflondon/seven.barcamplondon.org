		<description>Gary,
I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a good reason why it won&#039;t work. They are normal projectors, as far as I know, and if you have the right cable it should be OK.</description>

		<description>Hi, technical question, my presentation software runs directly from the Nokia N900 mobile computer with composite video out.
It has been tested on numerous video projectors with great success and merely needs the right kind of cable (which I have).
will I be able to use this for a presentation at barcamp?

		<description>We camp indoors at the venue. Bring a sleeping bag, pillow, inflatable mattress - whatever will make you comfortable :-)</description>

		<description>Try this:
http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/tubestationcarparks/default.aspx

Your best bet could be North Greenwich (as that&#039;s on a bit of the Jubilee which is not closed for engineering over that weekend). Then get the Jubilee to Waterloo. Weekend parking would be £6.</description>

		<description>Many thanks for the link. much appreciated. If leaving at a Tube station car park is a cheap and convenient option, can i get some more info - which tube station(waterloo - nearest?), what kind of parking is available at the tube stations- ncp or other , etc. sorry but central london gives me the shivers in terms of parking. :) cheers!</description>

		<description>I&#039;m afraid cheap parking nearby is extremely hard to come by!

Any chance you could leave it at a Tube station car park and come into central London by public transport?</description>
