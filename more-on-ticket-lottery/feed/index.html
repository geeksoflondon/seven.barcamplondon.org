		<description>I like this three stage idea.  The treasure hunt is a good way to motivate people who *really* want a ticket.  The lottery opens it up to more people (get a bit of new blood in there). The ticket rush is great for those who know they can be by a computer with a connection at a specific time.

I wondered if you&#039;d considered doing separate Szturday and Sunday tickets.  I know plenty of people who can&#039;t commit to a whole weekend, but would still love to attend.  It would help prevent the Sunday lull and would open it up to even more people.

		<description>Hi Terence,

I wondered if you&#039;d considered doing separate Saturday and Sunday tickets.  I know plenty of people who can&#039;t commit to a whole weekend, but would still love to attend.  It would help prevent the Sunday lull and would open it up to even more people.
